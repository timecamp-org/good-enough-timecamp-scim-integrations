#
# When both are true: Creates hybrid structure with department groups containing supervisor subgroups
# Example: "Engineering/John Smith", "Marketing/Jane Doe"
#
# When only TIMECAMP_USE_SUPERVISOR_GROUPS=true: Creates supervisor-only hierarchy
# Example: "John Smith", "John Smith/Bob Johnson"

# Department path prefix to skip when mapping departments between systems
# This allows removing a common prefix from all department paths
# Examples:
# - If department is "Company/Department/Team" and you set TIMECAMP_SKIP_DEPARTMENTS=Company
#   it will be mapped as "Department/Team" in TimeCamp
# - If department is "Company/Department/Team" and you set TIMECAMP_SKIP_DEPARTMENTS=Company/Department
#   it will be mapped as "Team" in TimeCamp
# - If department is exactly the same as TIMECAMP_SKIP_DEPARTMENTS, it will become empty
